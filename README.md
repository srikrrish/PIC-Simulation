# PIC-Simulation
### Author: Sriramkrishnan Muralikrishnan, Nigel Shen and Antoine Cerfon

This repository is forked from the original repository of https://github.com/Nigel-Shen/PIC-Simulation from Nigel Shen. It is a python prototyping code for particle-in-cell type methods for electrostatic plasma simulations. This repo is used to generate training data for https://github.com/srikrrish/NEOPIC . 

This is a Particle-In-Cell code. We have code for 1 and 2 dimensions. In each folder named PICnD, the main file is picnd.py where n is the dimension. We also have a modified Particle-In-Fourier version, whose main file is pifnd.py.
